Included a map in the searchgrid that allows generic places to be added and searched for by agents
Added reading of csv files to places so that lists of co-ordintaes of given types of places can be included
29/04/2020
Sketched out some functions to help make population more realistic in agentFactory
Time to reach hospital also now read in from diseaseParameterFile
Slight simplification in searchgrid check(vector<agent*>)
Parallel loops in serachGrid for counting
Some simple tests added to disease.cpp
28/04/2020
Time in hospital and in critical care now set from disease parameter file
Distributions over time in hospital etc. all set to exponential using above timings
Disease now allows for hospitalization, critical care and death (only CFR of hospital cases)
Update outputs for above
Parallel (openMP) loops now possible in re-gridding of agent locations
27/04/2020
Allowed for some people with disease to be asymptomatic
Parameters can now read in and store tables of hospitalization and critical care rates for diseases
Added a disease hospital and critical care csv
Disease parameters can now be read in from a csv file (stored in the parameters singleton)
Added a csv reader
26/04/2020
By default parameters used in a run are output to a file called RunParameters
Parameters in this file now grouped using categories in the parameterFile
Added a line to main so as to output model local starting time and date
Added naming scheme for experiments and directories: directories for output from every run now auto-created if needed
24/04/2020
Redesigned the disease class. Multiple simultaneous infectious diseases now possible
Diseases have a few stages each exponentially distributed.
23/04/2020
Added asciiGird to searcGrid with arbitrary x/y ranges and co-ordinates.
Created aggregators limited by a set of upper and lower x/y co-ordinates
Created cell aggregators to a fixed regular x-y size in searchGrid
Added the ability to set missing in searchGrid asciiGridFileWriter, but with default set to -9999
Added functions to retrieve searchgrid x/y size and origin
Renamed asciigrid in population builder to clarify where from
Made index of missing cells private in asciiGrid
Bugfix in population builder (not returning a value on probabilistic estimate when pop in a cell<1)
22/04/2020
Added an outputs class to abstract writing results to files.
Gridded files supported by passing a function to the searchGrid so that it can sum over agents
Searchgrid has a function to return an asciiGridFileWriter matched to its co-ordinates
Parameter file updated to include filenames for output to gridded spatial maps
asciiGridFileWriter able to take time series of (regular) grids in ARC format (but with only a single header)
