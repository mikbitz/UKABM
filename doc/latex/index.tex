This model is aimed at representing the patterns of movement and interaction of agents that represent individual people as they go about their daily activities.

The current objective is to be able to model the C\+O\+V\+I\+D-\/19 outbreak of 2020, and to tie this to agent behaviour at the scale of an entire country.\hypertarget{index_intro_sec}{}\section{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
